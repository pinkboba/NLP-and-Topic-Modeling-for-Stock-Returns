Predicting Stock Returns from Earnings Call Transcripts: A Machine Learning Approach

This repository explores the predictive power of textual data from earnings call transcripts on stock market returns.  By utilizing machine learning techniques we can analyze the language used in these announcements and identify patterns that may signal future stock performance.

The analysis proceeds in four main steps:

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:
Load earnings call transcripts and corresponding stock price data.
Clean and preprocess the textual data, including removing stop words, punctuation, and converting to lowercase.
Extract relevant features from the transcripts, such as word frequencies and n-grams.
Topic Modeling with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA):

2. Apply LDA to the corpus of earnings call transcripts to identify underlying topics.
Extract the top 5 words associated with each topic to understand the thematic structure of the language used.
Lasso Regression for Topic Significance:

3. Use Lasso regression to identify the topics that most strongly predict stock returns.
Analyze the coefficients of the Lasso model to understand the direction and magnitude of the relationship between topics and returns.
Classification for Predicting Large Positive Returns:

4. Train a classifier (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest) to predict the probability of a large positive return (>5% over a 3-day period) following an earnings announcement.
Use the identified topics or individual words as features for the classifier.
Evaluate the performance of the classifier using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
